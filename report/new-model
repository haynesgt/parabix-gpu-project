Parabix was built with pararellism in mind, but the division of data into small CPU-sized blocks runs deep in the Parabix architecture. These blocks are 128-512 bits in size. With the GPU, it is possible to run a trillion operations per second using thousands of cores on gigabyte-sized blocks. This opens up a new world of high-performance processing.

The Parabix model divides the program into kernels which execute on a block of data at a time, and are bound together as producers and consumers. With this view, it makes little difference whether operations are 100% parallel or almost 100% parallel. The 'add' operation on a SIMD register uses few instructions, so it is counted as a parellel operation, even though the fastest add algorithm requires a logarithmic depth circuit. When the program is taken to the GPU where there are thousands of cores, addition programs must use special `ballot` / `vote` instructions, for threads to know where long carries start and where they end.

A GPU can search for regex matches a thousand times faster than the file can be transferred to the device. It takes about .3 seconds to transfer a gigabyte to the device. When divided among 1000 threads, the same time gives each thread 300 million operations to search a one-megabyte section for matches, which is much more than needed for simple expressions. To make use of the extra time, it is better to use the GPU to search for many patterns in parallel. This is useful for spam filters, search engines, DNA pattern finding, and other text searching.
